The MIS department was a pioneer in forging and developing the MIS discipline. We have a long history of accomplishments and our graduates have been excelling in organizations all over the world.

The initiatives and activities that are currently taking place here are incredible. On the research front, the department has achieved the largest external funding base of any MIS department or, as a matter of fact, any business school in the country. This not only demonstrates the prestige and high expertise of our faculty, but the recognition that we understand the broader role of IT and information systems as the foundation and source of innovation for organizations and modern society.

In the last year alone, our faculty have secured close to $100 million of external funding to work on interdisciplinary research encompassing innovative projects such as iPlant, Border Security and the Dark Web cyber security projects. The accomplishments of our internationally renowned faculty are really outstanding.

What is really unique and exciting in our department is that our research excellence is fully integrated into real-life business solutions and most importantly, into our academic programs.
